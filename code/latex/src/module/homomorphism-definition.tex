\begin{definition}
  Let
    $R$ be a commutative ring with unity,
    $V$ and $W$ be $R$-modules,
    $f \colon V \to W$.
  We say that $f$ is \textbf{linear} (or a \textbf{homomorphism}) if for any
  $\lambda, \mu \in R$, $u, v \in V$,
  \begin{equation}
    f(\lambda u + \mu v) = \lambda f(u) + \mu f(v).
  \end{equation}
  The space of all homomorphisms between $V$ and $W$ is denoted by $\Hom(V, W)$.
  An \textbf{endomorphism} is a homorphism from a module to itself.
  The space of all endomorphisms on $V$ is denoted by $\End V := \Hom(V, V)$.
\end{definition}
