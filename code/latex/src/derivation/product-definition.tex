\begin{definition}
  Let
  {
    $R$ be a commutative ring with unity,
    $A$ and $B$ be $R$-algebras,
    $D_A$ and $D_B$ be derivations on $A$ and $B$ respectively.
  }
  Define the map $D \colon A \otimes B \to A \otimes B$ as follows:
  it is the unique linear map such that for simple tensors
  $a \otimes b \in A \otimes B$,
  \begin{equation}
    D(a \otimes b) := D_A a \otimes b + a \otimes D_B b.
  \end{equation}
  We call the map $D$ the \textbf{tensor product of derivations}
  and denote it by $D_A \otimes D_B$.
\end{definition}
